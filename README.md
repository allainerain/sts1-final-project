# Project Summary üìù

This powerpoint-like interactive story was created for the final project for STS 1 under Minimo Likha. This goal was to create an educational tool for children to learn about the impact of electric vehicles, especially in the context of the Philippines. This project features the story of Manong Manuel and OJ as they go through the modernization of public utility vehicles in the Philippines. Throughout the story, tooltips are available for the children to learn new terms.

The interactive story also features a basic crossword to test the children on the things that they've learned throughout the story.
